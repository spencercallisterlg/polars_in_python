# Parsing and Cleaning a CSV export

In this challenge, we want to explore some country metrics provided by the World Bank. We will start from the raw `.csv` downloaded from their website. 

1. Read in the `.csv`
2. Clean the formatting
3. Save near raw format to `.parquet`
4. Wrangle the data for exploration
5. Build a few exploration visuals

## Folders

- `scripts_complete`: Has the complete scripts for each objective
- `data`: has the raw data and some derived data from the scripts
